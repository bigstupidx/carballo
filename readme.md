Carballo Chess Engine
=====================

Carballo (the galician word for Oak, it's all about search trees) is an Open Source Java chess engine with two interfaces:

* UCI: a text interface for chess GUIs: https://github.com/albertoruibal/carballo/raw/master/carballo-uci-1.7.tgz
* HTML5: developed with Google Web Toolkit (GWT) using the Vectomatic SVG library: http://www.mobialia.com/webchessgwt

It is organized into modules:

* Core: the chess engine
* Jse: the Java Standard Edition version with the UCI interface and JUnit tests
* Gwt: components needed for the GWT GUI
* GwtGui: an HTML5 interface developed by Lukas Laag, it depends on Core and Gwt
* Applet: the applet code (deprecated), it depends on Core and Jse

From version 1.7, Java artifacts are uploaded to the Maven repository https://bintray.com/albertoruibal/maven

The Core and the UCI interface are converted to C# in the project http://github.com/albertoruibal/carballo_cs

It is licensed under GPLv3 and the source code is hosted at https://github.com/albertoruibal/carballo.
You are free to use, distribute or modify the code, we ask for a mention to the original authors and/or a link to our pages.

Features
========

* UCI interface for chess GUIs like Arena or SCID
* It includes a great GWT interface by Lukas Laag and a deprecated Java Applet GUI
* Based on bitboards with a magic bitboard move generator, it also includes code for magic number generation
* Move iterator sorting moves with four killer move slots, Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE), Most Valuable Victim/Least Valuable Aggressor (MVV/LVA) and history heuristic
* PVS searcher
* Aspiration window, moves only one border of the window if it falls out
* Transposition Table (TT) with zobrist keys (it uses two zobrist keys per board to avoid collisions) and multiprobe
* Quiescent Search (QS) with only good or equal captures (according to SEE) and limited check generation
* Internal Iterative Deepening to improve sorting
* Extensions: Check (only with positive SEE), pawn push, mate threat and singular move
* Reductions: Late Move Reductions (LMR)
* Pruning: Null move pruning, static null move pruning, futility pruning and history pruning
* Pluggable evaluator function, distinct functions provided: the Simplified Evaluator Function, other Complete and other Experimental
* Selectable ELO level with an UCI parameter
* Supports Chess960
* Polyglot opening book support; in the code it includes Fruit's Small Book
* FEN notation import/export support, also EPD support for testing
* JUnit used for testing, multiple test suites provided (Perft, BS2830, BT2630, LCTII, WinAtChess, etc.)

Test results in my Intel Core i7-3667U CPU limited to 1.9GHz and without turbo boost for consistency:
